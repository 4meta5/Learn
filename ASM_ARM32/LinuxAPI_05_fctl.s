@Example of fcntl API. API calls found in this example program:
@ 	open, close, fcntl, exit
@ High level description of what theis example program does:
@	Opens a file with the open() API.
@	Changes the flags for the file to NOATIME, APPEND, and WRONLY using fcntl()_SETFD
@	Checks the flags of the file using fcntl()_GETFD (making sure the previously set value gets returned into EAX)
@	closes the file handle with close()
@	exits program with exit()
