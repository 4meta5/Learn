Regular Expressions (Meat)
=====
General Goals to make use of Regular Expressions

* How to show whether an expression matches (or not) a string
* Use multiple modifiers for one regex (case insensitive, multiline, etc...)
* Show how to split a string into an array with a regex defined delimiter
* Show how to parse/capture individual peices of a string using regex

The Regular Expression example script is called re.py
